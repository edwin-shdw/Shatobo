## TikTok

#### Video <!-- omit from toc -->
If viewing a video click the extension icon. You will see a `Download` button and a QR code. Using
either of them will download the currently viewed video. The QR code is pretty handy if you want to
download it on your phone.

#### Images <!-- omit from toc -->

TikTok's algorithm won't show you any TikToks with a image carousel if you use the browser version.
However you can still view them e.g. by viewing your liked TikToks. If you click the extension icon
while viewing one the menu will list all images inside this carousel. You can open them in a new tab
individually by clicking the according image or open all by clicking the `Open all` button.

## Instagram
Right clicking images on Instagram won't show any image specific options like `Open image in new tab`
or `Save image as...`. Shatobo will break this behavior so you will see the usual image options as
usual.

## Spotify

#### Covers <!-- omit from toc -->

Right clicking most of Spotify's UI will show a custom menu. Shatobo will extend this menu if you
right click an cover image making it possible to open the image in a new tab.

#### Lyrics <!-- omit from toc -->

By default you can't select the lyrics after opening a [track link](https://open.spotify.com/track/4ER6nCcTKGMC1405EtHUy5). Shatobo will correct this so it is possible to select the lyrics.

## YouTube
The download button below videos will redirect to a page where the video can be downloaded for free.
